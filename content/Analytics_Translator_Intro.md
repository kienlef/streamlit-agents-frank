# The Analytics Translator

The Analytics Translator — the career path of a Data Scientist?

Analytics translators have the goal of integrating analytics capabilities in a company. They should identify value cases for the business, and they should help deploy data-driven applications to support or automate intelligent decision making.The role is new and not yet well defined. Attention, it should be clear that this role or related roles will continuously evolve, and as well the role name might change.

This article tries to illuminate the vast possibilities within your analytics translator journey. The article is an excerpt from my lecture class, [Data Science Career — The Analytics Translator](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-analytics-translator/?referralCode=C7867E8B4A33A7DD211C)

Please remember that an article or as well a MOOC can mostly teach facts. However, for the translator role, one has typically gone through different positions and situations in practice with constant feedback.

Each learning path is different. Thus the article will focus on a better understanding of the connected terminology between multiple subjects.
